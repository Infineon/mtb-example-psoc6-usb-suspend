# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: USB suspend and resume

This example demonstrates how PSoC&trade; 6 MCU detects a USB suspend condition, enters a low-power state, and restores normal operation when USB activity resumes.

PSoC&trade; 6 MCU operates in the CPU active power mode before the host decides to suspend the USB device. The PSoC&trade; 6 MCU device
goes to deep sleep as soon as a suspend condition is detected so that it consumes less power. The USB device maximum suspend current should not exceed 500 µA (for a low-power device) to be compliant with the USB specification. When the host decides to wake up the USB device, it drives a resume condition on the bus. This drives the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU device to wake up and change its power mode to CPU active.

The example uses an LED to indicate the USB device state as well as the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU power mode. The LED is OFF when
a suspend condition is detected and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU is in deep sleep. The LED is ON when the USB is active and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU is in CPU active power mode.

To see the USB descriptor, use the **usbdev-configurator** tool located at *<ModusToolbox_install_dir>/tools_\<version\>/usbdev-configurator*. In the tool, open the *design.cyusbdev* file located under the */COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<BSP\>* folder.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional

`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; softwre</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Connect another USB cable (or reuse the same cable used to program the kit) to the USB device connector.

5. In the PC, verify that a new USB device enumerates as a virtual COM port.

6. Run any terminal emulator and make a new connection to the virtual COM port. Observe the message “USB is active” periodically printed in the terminal. Observe that the kit LED is ON.

7. To put the device into suspend mode, on a Windows PC, go to the Start menu and put the PC into sleep mode. This makes
the USB traffic stop; PSoC&trade; 6 MCU enters the suspend mode, and the LED turns OFF.

   **Note:** When putting the PC in sleep, the board should be powered either by connecting KitProg3 connector to another PC or power source.

   **Note:** If the USB host cable is disconnected while keeping the board powered through the KitProg connector, the device goes to deep sleep.

8. Use the mouse or keyboard to wake up the PC. The host generates a resume condition on the USB; PSoC&trade; 6 MCU resumes and restores communication through USB (the device is not enumerated again). Observe that the LED in the kit is ON again.

9. After the PC wakes up, the communication with the USBFS device can be observed as described in Step 5.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

In the main firmware routine, the USBFS block is configured to use the communication device class (CDC). After enumeration, the device periodically checks for activity every 1 ms. The USB device is suspended if there is no activity on the bus for longer than 3 ms. Normally, Start-Of-Frame (SOF) packets are sent by the host every 1 ms. The USBFS driver layer is not capable of tracking the suspend condition by itself. Therefore, a timer is placed in the design to provide ticks each 1 ms. The USB activity is checked every tick to identify when bus is idle for 3 ms.

After the USB suspend condition is detected, PSoC&trade; 6 MCU leaves the CPU active power mode and goes to deep sleep. This allows the device to reduce power consumption while the host does not communicate with it. Before going to deep sleep, the LED is turned OFF, the timer is disabled, and the wakeup source interrupt is enabled. The wakeup source is the falling edge on the USB Dp pin. The `Cy_USBFS_Dev_Drv_Suspend()` function is also called to prepare the USB hardware block to enter suspend mode.

When the host wants to wake the device up after the suspend condition, it does so by reversing the polarity of the signal on the data lines for at least 20 ms. The signal is completed with the low-speed end of the packet signal. As soon as the Dp pin polarity is reverted, PSoC&trade; 6 MCU wakes up because a wakeup event occurs (falling edge on the Dp pin). The USBFS hardware block configuration is restored by calling the `Cy_USBFS_Dev_Drv_Resume()` function. The timer is re-enabled, the LED is turned ON, and the wakeup source interrupt is disabled.
